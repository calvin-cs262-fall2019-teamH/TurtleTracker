# TurtleTracker

	The Turtle Tracker project will assist those at the Calvin Eco Preserve when keeping track of the box turtles on sight. The box turtle is a threatened species, so they keep track of them to ensure the population is doing well. This app will allow users to make turtle entity using their smartphone instead of having to take the turtle from its location, make a physical entry, and walk the turtle back to the location they found it. The worker who finds the turtle can make a turtle entity in the app, or update an existing turtle entity. They can also see all of the turtle entities and delete turtles if they run away. There will be pictures of the turtles with basic facts and the different sighting locations. In addition, there will be a way to search the current index of turtles within the app.
	This project will consist of a front end app (Typescript with React Native) that will be the way the preserve workers interact with their turtle index. There will be another app (Node.js with Express.js) to service as the API and will access the turtle database (PostgreSQL).

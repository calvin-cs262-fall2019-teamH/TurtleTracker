# Running the App
To view a working build of the `master` branch, checkout this [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@git/github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2019-teamH/TurtleTracker)

(Please note that snack.expo.io is buggy at times and the preview might fail the run. This does not reflect the current state of our project.)

To run the front-end app locally, run `npm start` and scan the QR Code using the [Expo App](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779?amp%3Bct=www&amp%3Bmt=8&pt=17102800). 
Note you may need to run `npm install` the first time you run the app.
